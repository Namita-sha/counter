 JavaScript Counter

This is a simple and interactive counter web application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It includes three buttons to increase, decrease, and reset a displayed count in real-time.

This project is part of my journey to learn JavaScript. I built it by following a tutorial video from Bro Code on YouTube.

Features
- Increase the count
- Decrease the count
- Reset the count to zero
- Live update of count display
- Easy to understand and modify

How It Works

- The increaseBtn, decreaseBtn, and resetBtn buttons are selected using getElementById.
- When clicked:
  - increaseBtn increments the counter.
  - decreaseBtn decrements the counter.
  - resetBtn resets it to zero.
- The updated count is shown by changing the .textContent of the countLabel element.

 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
